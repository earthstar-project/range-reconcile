# range_reconcile

A module for the efficient reconciliation of sets. This is a TypeScript
implementation of range-based set reconciliation as described in
[Aljoscha Meyer's master thesis](https://github.com/AljoschaMeyer/master_thesis).

In this method peers generate fingerprints for ranges of items they hold in a
totally ordered set.

When two ranges from different peers hold the same items, they produce the same
fingerprint.

But when two ranges are different from one another, they produce different
fingeprints. The two peers then subdivide non-matching ranges, generating and
comparing fingerprints until the ranges are whittled down to the disjoint
elements, which are then exchanged.

## About this implementation

This implementation has the following features:

- A reasonably fast self-balancing `FingerprintTree` built upon Deno's std
  `RedBlackTree`. This is used to hold your set's values and generate
  fingerprints for ranges.
- BYOLM (Bring your own Lifting Monoid) - Fingerprinting is made possible by a
  'lifting monoid', a monoid with an additional function that 'lifts' a value
  into another kind of value (e.g. a hashing function).
- An efficient message-based protocol for describing ranges between peers which
  can be used locally or over a network.
- BYOE (Bring Your Own Encoding) - How messages are encoded and decoded is left
  to the user.
- BYOT (Bring Your Own Transport)- `RangeMessenger` has a single `respond`
  method which takes and returns an encoded message, which you then transport to
  the other peer in whichever way you prefer.

One caveat: the `FingerprintTree` provided by this module can only store its
values in memory.

## Using this moudule

### Outline

At the broadest level:

1. For each set you wish to reconcile, instantiate a `FingerprintTree` and
   insert that set's elements.
2. Create a `RangeMessenger` for each `FingerprintTree`.
3. Reconcile the sets by exchanging messages between two `RangeMessengers`.

### Detailed usage

### Importing

```js
import {
  FingerprintTree,
  RangeMessenger,
} from "https://deno.land/x/range_reconcile/mod.ts";
```

NPM distribution coming soon!

#### FingerprintTree

The `FingerprintTree` is used as the representation of a set you wish to
reconcile. Instantiation requires a 'lifting monoid' to be provided, and
optionally a function with which to compare inserted values.

This lifting monoid is important because it is used to generate the fingerprints
which peers exchange and compare their own fingerprints to.

Therefore the lifting monoid **must** satisfy the following criteria:

1. The lift method must map every item that could possibly occur in a set to a
   value from the monoid, that is, to a value that can be combined with other
   such values according to the next two rules. `lift(item)` is the fingerprint
   of the set that contains only item. For larger sets, the fingerprint is
   computed by `combine`ing the results of `lift(item)` of all the individual
   items in the larger set.
2. The combine method must be associative â€” i.e.
   `combine(a, combine(b, c)) === combine(combine(a, b), c)`
3. The neutral value must be a value from the monoid that leaves other (monoid)
   values unaffected when combining them with it: combine(a, neutral) === a and
   combine(neutral, a) === a.

#### RangeMessenger

Once you have a FingerprintTree containing the values you wish to reconcile, you
can instantiate a `RangeMessenger` which generates the messages for another
peer.

This `RangeMessenger` requires a configuration which describes how to decode and
encode messages from and to the other peer respectively.

Once instantiated, the initial messages to send to the other peer can be
generated with the `initialMessages` method.

Upon receiving a message, it should be passed to `RangeMessenger.respond`, which
returns the response to be sent back in turn.

How messages are sent and received is up to you. Just make sure that whichever
system you choose sends and processes the messages in order (i.e. first-in,
first-out).
